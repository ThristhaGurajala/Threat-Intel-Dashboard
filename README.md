# Threat Intelligence Dashboard

This project demonstrates a **Threat Intelligence Dashboard** that visualizes Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), attack campaigns, and threat trends.  
It is designed to help SOC teams and analysts quickly identify malicious activity patterns.

## 🔹 Project Overview
- Interactive dashboard built with **Power BI**.  
- Visualizes IOC data (IPs, domains, malware names).  
- Helps track phishing, malware, and suspicious traffic trends.  
- Simulates real SOC threat intel workflows.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for dashboard visualization  
- **Excel/CSV** for IOC datasets  
- **Python (optional)** for preprocessing IOC feeds  

## 📂 Project Files
- `ioc_feed.csv` → Sample dataset of IOCs (domains, IPs, malware names).  
- `Threat_Dashboard.pbix` → Power BI dashboard file.  
- `dashboard_screenshot.png` → Screenshot of the dashboard.
